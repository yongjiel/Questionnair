=========  Philosophy =========

1. Design:  Since it is a small Questionnaire, it shows to user all the questions
   in one page to let user know it is not the endless questions there. It can be 
   turned to pagination if more questions.

2. Use Username (email) to make sure one person (one email address used) is able 
   to submit once. There is a validator check there. This can be bound to login 
   function of further development. This data is kept in answer table of database.

3. Use database driven design. It helps no hard code data into source code.

4. Questions and answers are put to two diff tables in sqlite3 database.

5. Answer table's metadata question_id is referenced to question table's id.

6. Editting questions is able to work at http://localhost:5000/admin/question. Also
   some fileds has validaation check, like type field.

7. Answers table info can be viewed at http://localhost:5000/admin/answer.

8. This app is designed in dynamic programming. It is easy to upgrade and add more 
   functions or for maintenance purpose.
